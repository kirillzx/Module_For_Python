# Module_For_Python
In many applications you need to use some measures to evaluate the matrix or stop a numercial method therefore was developed a C module for Python for calculating the various norms of vectors and matrix.

## Authors
Kirill Zakharov, Maxim Zotov

## How start to work with module?
```python
just type from MatrixNorm import *
``````
