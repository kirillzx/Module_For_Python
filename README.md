# Module_For_Python
In many applications you need to use some measures to evaluate the matrix or stop a numercial method therefore was developed a C module for Python for calculating the various norms of vectors and matrix.

## How start to work with module?
just type *from MatrixNorm import**
## Functions
1. NormManhattan - calculate the Manhattan distance
2. NormEuclidean - calculate the  Euclidean norm
3. NormInfinity - calculate the Infinity norm
4. NormLp - calculate the p norm of the space L
5. matrixNormOne - calculate the matrix norm one
6. matrixNormInfinity - calculate the infinity matrix norm
7. matrixNormFrobenius - calculate the Frobenius norm
8. matrixNormLp - calculate the matrix norm p of the space L
